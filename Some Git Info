Some git information

We found that when we cloned the master branch onto our workspace
that when we wanted to push a new branch we needed to do the following to push it back up.

	- git checkout -b <branchname> to switch to the branch
	- git push --set-upstream origin <branchname>

We may not have done the initial setup right and that is why we ended up having to do it.

Hope this helps!!
